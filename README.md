# Tetrecs
## What is Tetrecs?
• A fast-paced block placement game
• You have a 5x5 grid
• You must place pieces in that grid
• You score by clearing lines, horizontally or vertically
• You can rotate pieces 
• You can store a single piece to come back to later 
• The more lines you clear in one go, the more points you get 
• Every piece that you play that clears at least one line increases your score multiplier 
• As your score goes up, so does your level, and you get less time to think 
• If you fail to place a block, you lose a life 
• Lose 3 lives, and you’re out of the game
